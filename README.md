# KiepTeletext
### A C# WPF Viewer for the Dutch NOS teletext

Contains short and concise news and weather information. Ideal for visual impaired.
Unfortunately the NOS is no longer offering the teletext in GIF format, so the application does not work anymore.

See [KiepProjects](https://github.com/Joozt/KiepProjects) for an overview of all Kiep projects.
